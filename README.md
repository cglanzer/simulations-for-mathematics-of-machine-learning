## Simulations for "Mathematics of Machine Learning"

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks which I've written for the lecture [**"401-2684-00L Mathematics of Machine Learning"**](http://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=152806&semkez=2021S&lang=de) held at ETH Zürich by [Prof. Dr. Afonso Bandeira](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~abandeira/index.html) in Spring 2021.


### Instructions on how to run the code

**Cloning the repository:** The easiest way is to clone the entire repository and to run the notebooks locally.

**Using Google Colab:** If you have a Google / Gmail account, you can click on the following link to directly open and run the Jupyter notebooks: [Click here!](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cglanzer/simulations-for-mathematics-of-machine-learning.)
After opening the page, login with your Google account and click on “Connect” on the top-right corner of the page. Now, you can execute the code cells by clicking on the small play button next to the snippets.

**Using Binder (no account needed):** Navigate to [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). Next, copy-paste the following URL next to “GitHub” and click “Launch”: https://github.com/cglanzer/simulations-for-mathematics-of-machine-learning. It will take a while for Binder to download the repository. As soon as this is completed, you can select one of the notebooks and run and play around with the code.
